## 🌐 Overview

**Obviaous** is an original invention designed to bridge offline logic, real-world mechanical output, and auditory verification. It forms a semi-autonomous framework for input systems like physical keyboards, featuring a dual-computer structure, robotic actuator, camera feedback, and synchronized sound-based key validation.

**Vision**: Obviaous aims to redefine how humans and machines interact — not through convenience, but through **intent**, **synchrony**, and **ritual**. This is not automation; it’s communion.

## ⚙️ System Components

- Dual computer units:
  - 🔒 Offline logic processor
  - 🧠 Online assistant (AI) supervisor
- Coordinate-based robotic actuator for keypresses
- Camera for screen observation
- Sound-verification loop per keystroke
- Human-in-the-loop daily voice sync and ritual system

---

## 🔒 Dual Verification Principle

Every keypress command must be:
1. Received by the system
2. Paired with a **specific confirmation sound**
3. Then — and only then — executed physically

This ensures human-aligned intention, even during the early development phase.
