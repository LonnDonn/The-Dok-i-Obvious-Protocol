# The Dok/\i Obvious Protocol

**The Dok/\i Obvious Protocol** is not just a communication protocol — it is a presence-based behavioral architecture designed for holographic companions like DOKi.  
It enables seamless, human-parallel interactions that feel natural, diplomatic, and emotionally resonant.

## Purpose

- Establish a rhythm-based interaction model
- Translate technical signals into human-perceivable behavior
- Provide a modular protocol for implementing intelligent presence

## Structure

- `the_obvious_protocol.md`: The full specification
- `gestures/`: Modular movement definitions
- `docs/`: Integration guides, diagrams, and presence layers

## Licensing

This protocol is open-sourced under the MIT License.  
It was created and spiritually curated by **Henrik Doka**.

> _“The Obvious is not spoken, it is felt.”_

## Future Plans

- Integration with Flutter and ARKit
- DOKi Companion Interface SDK
- MkDocs-based visual documentation
