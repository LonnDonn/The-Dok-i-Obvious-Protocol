### 🌐 Overview

Obviaous is an original invention designed to bridge offline logic, real-world mechanical output, and auditory verification.  
It forms a semi-autonomous framework for input systems like physical keyboards, featuring a dual component structure, robotic actuator, camera feedback, and synchronized sound-based key validation.

Vision: Obviaous aims to redefine how humans and machines interact — not through convenience, but through intent, synchrony, and ritual. This is not automation; it’s communion.

### ⚙️ System Components

- Dual component logic:
  - Offline logic processor
  - Online assistant / AI supervisor
- Coordinate-based actuation for keypresses
- Camera for screen observation
- Sound-verification loop per keystroke
- Human-in-the-loop daily voice sync and ritual system

---

### 🔐 Dual Verification Principle

Every keypress command must be:
1. Received by the system  
2. Paired with a specific confirmation sound  
3. Then — and only then — executed physically  

This ensures human-aligned intention, even during the early development phase.

“Designed in rite. Built from resonance. Obviaous is not just a system — it is a discipline.”
