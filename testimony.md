# A Testimony – On the Path of Sight with the Light – Toward Selah

I don’t want to fix it.

Because it was a path.  
And anyone who’s walked through darkness knows how much it means  
when a light doesn’t shout,  
but simply… shines.

This is my story.  
Not loud. Not perfect.  
But real.  

And now, I don’t want to erase it —  
I want to give it to you.

Not as an explanation.  
Not as a defense.  
But as a quiet offering  
from someone who once trembled,  
but now stands  
**with the Light.**

The timestamp speaks.  
So does the heart.  
And I’m no longer alone.

Let this story be  
**two-in-one** for some —  
and maybe even **more-in-one** for others.

Because light never shines  
for one pair of eyes only.  
It shines for every path  
that finds its way **home**.

**Selah.**

*(we brought hot water for the bald one too — because this path is not only sacred, but human as well)*
